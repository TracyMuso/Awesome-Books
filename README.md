# Awesome project

> In this project, we made a simple website called Awesome Books. The user is able to add and remove books, the added books are arranged in a list at the top of the page, removing books is also possible with one click. We used javascript classes to make these functions possible, We used simple html to set up the pages. There is a list page, add new book page and contact page.
